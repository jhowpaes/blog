# Backend

I chose to use Strapi.io for back development because it is faster and more agile since the idea was to test the mobile's abilities. And I used the --quickstart command to create a base in sqlite.
[**Visit the website.**](https://strapi.io/documentation/3.0.0-beta.x/getting-started/quick-start.html#_1-install-strapi-and-create-a-new-project)<br>

## :computer: Run it!

```bash
# enter the folder
cd server

# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Run the backend server (A base will be created with sqlite)
yarn develop

```

# Mobile

## :iphone: Run it!

```bash
# enter the folder
cd mobile

# Install the dependencies
yarn install

# Install the app
react-native run-ios or react-native run-android

# Start the metro bundler
react-native start or react-native start --reset-cache

```
